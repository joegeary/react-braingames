## Sudoku

Sudoku is a number placing puzzle based on a 9x9 grid with several given numbers. The object is to place the numbers 1 to 9 in the empty squares so that each row, each column and each 3x3 box contains the same number only once.

**Rules**
* A number can only appear only once on each row
* A number can only appear only once on each column
* A number can only appear only once on each 3x3 box
* The pre-placed "given" numbers cannot be changed
* A square can only contain a number from 1 to 9
